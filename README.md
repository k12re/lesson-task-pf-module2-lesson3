### Question 5

Select the `ul` element in the HTML file, loop through the array below and create a `li` element containing the product name and price properties.

```js
var products = [
	{

	},
	{
		name: "Bucket of water",
		price: 459.99,
	},
	{
		name: "4 cabbages",
		price: 500.95,

Your final HTML should look like this:

```html
<ul>
	<li>Elephant eggs - 45.00</li>
	<li>Bucket of water - 459.99</li>
	<li>4 cabbages - 500.95</li>
</ul>
